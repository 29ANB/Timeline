                <small>Feburary 11 2023</small>
                <p>When I arrived at the park I saw that some of my brothers friends were there and my grandparents were there. They boys were playing soccer so I decided to join. We played until more people came to the party and we started to do the fun stuff.</p>

                <h2>The Games</h2>
                <small>Feburary 11 2023</small>
                <p>The first game we started with was musical chairs, well we started a normal game but we didn't have a speaker so we had to play with my grandmas tablet that we couldn't hear. Well long story short I was close to winning but one of my brothers friends one. Another game was when you had to tie a balloon to your ankle and prevent other people poping it, but you had to try to pop theirs too. Well halfway in the game I popped my own balloon, my little brother won the game. One last game was you needed a partner and one of the had to lay down. The person standing up had a string with a donut covered in chocolate and had to feed the person laying down blindfolded. Well my oldest cousin and his partner won.</p>

                <small>Feburary 11 2023</small>
                <p>Well after the having some of the cake and cupcakes we started to get ready to hit the pinata. I was first up and I gave some damage to the pinata. As more kids started to hit the pinata was going to go down. I took the last hits and there was candy flying every where.</p>
